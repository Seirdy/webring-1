    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
        A community of sites around a common topic, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>.
        Each member includes a badge on their site that links to the previous and next sites in the ring.
        Kids in the 90s used to love it!
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <p>
        To join the webring, <a href="{{ meta.repo }}/compare">open a pull request</a>
        and supply the name and URL of your site. If you publish a RSS feed, you can provide that as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/stavros">Tweet to Stavros</a> and ask to be included (make sure you
        mention your site's URL).
    </p>

    <h2>Add the banner</h2>
    <p>
        Once you've joined the ring, copy this code snippet into your site:
    </p>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        If you don't like JS or just don't want the default widget, you can just link to the proper URLs and style the
        section yourself:
    </p>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'links.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It will render this banner that links to the other members:
    </p>

    {% include 'snippet.njk' %}
