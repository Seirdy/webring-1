# Code of Conduct

To be in this webring, you need to have an interest in technology and making things with technology.
The rule is intentionally left vague because it's more of a "we'll know it when we see it" thing.

However, there is also a "don't be an asshole" rule, which says that you shouldn't be an asshole.
The rule is intentionally left vague because it's more of a "we'll know it when we see it" thing.

Basically, this code of conduct is useless, because we're going by clique aesthetic and there are no rules that can quantify that.

Enjoy!
